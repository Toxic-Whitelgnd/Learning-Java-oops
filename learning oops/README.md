## Learning OOPS

Learnt baasic of creating class and constructor

## 4 types

> Abstraction
> Encapsulation
> Inheritance
> Polymorphism


- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies


## Polymorphisim

> Overloading
> Compile time - inheritance

> overriding
> Run time

## Inheritance

> Single level inheritance
> Multilevel inheritance
> Hiereachiacl inheritance
> hybrid inheritance
> multiple inheritance -- not used but used in the form of interface

## Encapsulation

# In this Packages will be covered
> Access Modifier
  -- Public --> can access anywhere
  -- Default --> can access anything
  -- Protected --> only child and subclasses in the package can be accessed
  --- Private --> only accesss within the class to access this in java there will be 
              getters and setters

## Data Hiding
> process of protecting the member of the class from uninteneded changes 
## Abstraction 
> it is the procees of hiding the implementation and showing the essential thingsS
> use abstract keyword in front of class keyword
> abstract function and datatype can be used
> if u use abstract keyword in front of the function then no need to implement

## Interface
> use interface keyword 
> no constructor
> no function implementation
> we will use implements instead of extends
> in this we will be using multiple inheritance 

## Static keyword
> it is common to everyobject 
> if any thing is common then we can use static keyword
> directly accesssed by the class name no need to object
> it will save memory and map the objects to the static things becoz of the common things
> static can be used with properties , methods and blocks and nested class
